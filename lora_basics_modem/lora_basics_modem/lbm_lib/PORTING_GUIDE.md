# LoRa Basic Modem Porting Guide

## MCU Requirements

LoRa Basics Modem contains a example code for the STMicroelectronics STM32L476 Nucleo board, however, it can be easily ported to other MCUs. The following MCU features are required:  
- 32-bit native operation (No specific CPU core needed)
- Memory : Minimum 40KB of FLASH memory allowing an end-device to run in Class A mode for a single region; each additional region adds 1.5KB.
- Little-endian
- Software MCU reset
- A timer with 100Î¼s resolution or better (Timer accuracy compensation is possible by widening the LoRaWAN reception windows)
- A random number generator (can be implemented in software)
- Non-volatile storage for modem state storage
- An SPI controller with MISO, MOSI, SCK, NSS
- GPIO lines for the transceiver IRQ, BUSY, and RESET lines
- A dedicated (non-shared) GPIO MCU interrupt for the transceiver IRQ line is recommended  

Note that reliable Class A LoRaWAN communication can be obtained without any major time constraints on the MCU oscillator, or the oscillator used to clock the devices that implement the time-related LoRa Basics Modem HAL functions.  
To compensate for time-related oscillator frequency errors, calling the smtc_modem_set_crystal_error_ppm() modem API function with an appropriate value is sufficient.  
This results in a widening of the LoRaWAN reception window and increased power consumption.  
In the case of Class B, however, it is desirable to be able to remain synchronized with the beacon over relatively long time intervals, even if beacons are sometimes not received due to poor RF conditions.  
In this case, it is recommended to use an accurate crystal oscillator to clock the devices used to implement the time-related LoRa Basics Modem HAL functions.

## Transceiver Requirements

The transceivers supported by LoRa Basics Modem and their associated version if applicable can be found in LoRa Basics Modem [README.md](lbm_lib/README.md) file.  
In certain situations, such as the use of GNSS reception with the LR11xx, a transceiver TCXO is required. When using GNSS advanced scan on the LR11xx, the TCXO must have a relatively fast settling time, and the 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator must have 20ppm accuracy at 25 degrees.

## System Design Considerations

There are numerous requirements and options to consider when developing a device that implements LoRaWAN.  

For the LoRa Basics Modem, it is important to consider the transceiver and timer interrupt behavior and configuration. The LoRa Basics Modem is designed to use a specific transceiver DIO line as the radio interrupt source. For SX126x, this is the DIO1 line, and for LR11xx, this is the DIO9 line.
Two principal interrupt sources interact with the LoRa Basics Modem: a timer interrupt, and a radio interrupt.  
The system interrupt priorities must be configured in such a way that the timer and radio interrupts do not nest or interrupt each another.

Therefore, when designing hardware that will run LoRa Basics Modem, it is recommended that the MCU GPIO lines selected for the transceiver's DIO interrupt request line do not share an MCU interrupt flag with other timing-critical hardware. If MCU interrupt flags are shared, it may not always be possible to react immediately to interrupts originating from these other devices.  

No radio operations over the transceiver SPI bus are perfomed during timer and radio interrupt service routines.

## Radio Driver HAL Implementation

The LoRa Basics Modem depends on Semtech's radio driver, which, in turn, requires a radio driver HAL implementation.  
A brief description of the necessary steps for this implementation follows.  

The HAL implementation must provide platform-specific read, write, reset, and wakeup implementations.  
* Radio driver API functions call the HAL implementation to perform the actual reset, wake, and communication operations needed by the driver.
* For the `LR11xx`, these functions are documented in [lr11xx_hal.h](smtc_modem_core/radio_drivers/lr11xx_driver/src/lr11xx_hal.h).
* For the `SX126x`, these functions are documented in [sx126x_hal.h](smtc_modem_core/radio_drivers/sx126x_driver/src/sx126x_hal.h).
* For the `SX128x`, these functions are documented in [sx128x_hal.h](smtc_modem_core/radio_drivers/sx128x_driver/src/sx128x_hal.h).
* For the `SX127x`, these functions are documented in [sx127x_hal.h](smtc_modem_core/radio_drivers/sx127x_driver/src/sx127x_hal.h).

All radio driver API functions take a 'const void* context' argument:
* This argument is opaque to both the radio driver and LoRa Basics Modem.
* It may be used by the HAL implementer to differentiate between different transceivers, which makes it easy to communicate with several radios inside the same application.
* Driver API functions do not use the context argument but pass it directly to the HAL implementation.

The LoRa Basics Modem imposes a specific requirement on the radio driver HAL implementation:
* If a radio driver API function is called while the transceiver is in sleep mode, the HAL implementation must properly wake the transceiver and wait until it is ready before initiating any SPI communication.
* This typically requires that the HAL keeps track of whether the radio is awake or asleep, potentially by monitoring any commands sent to the transceiver to detect the SetSleep command.
* For a concrete LR11xx example, see the file: [lr11xx_hal.c](../lbm_examples/radio_hal/lr11xx_hal.c).
* For a concrete SX126x example, see the file: [sx126x_hal.c](../lbm_examples/radio_hal/sx126x_hal.c).
* For a concrete SX128x example, see the file: [sx128x_hal.c](../lbm_examples/radio_hal/sx128x_hal.c).
* For a concrete SX127x example, see the file: [sx127x_hal.c](../lbm_examples/radio_hal/sx127x_hal.c).

When compiling the radio driver HAL implementation, it is necessary to add the radio driver source directory to the include path.  
For example, for LR11xx:
* `lbm_lib/smtc_modem_core/radio_drivers/lr11xx_driver/src`

## RAL BSP Implementation

When porting the LoRa Basics Modem to a new radio + MCU implementation, a Radio Abstraction Layer (RAL) board support package (BSP) implementation is necessary.  
A brief description of the necessary steps follows.  

The RAL provides radio-independent API functions that are similar to those provided by each radio driver.  
The RAL, and a complementary layer called the RALF, are described in the following header functions:
* [ral.h](smtc_modem_core/smtc_ral/src/ral.h)
* [ralf.h](smtc_modem_core/smtc_ralf/src/ralf.h)

The RAL requires the implementer to define a few BSP API functions for the selected transceiver, by providing platform or radio-specific information to the RAL.
* For the `LR11xx`, these functions are described in [ral_lr11xx_bsp.h](smtc_modem_core/smtc_ral/src/ral_lr11xx_bsp.h).
* For the `SX126x`, these functions are described in [ral_sx126x_bsp.h](smtc_modem_core/smtc_ral/src/ral_sx126x_bsp.h).
* For the `SX128x`, these functions are described in [ral_sx128x_bsp.h](smtc_modem_core/smtc_ral/src/ral_sx128x_bsp.h).
* For the `SX127x`, these functions are described in [ral_sx127x_bsp.h](smtc_modem_core/smtc_ral/src/ral_sx127x_bsp.h).

* An LR11xx sample implementation is in the file [ral_lr11xx_bsp.c](../lbm_examples/radio_hal/ral_lr11xx_bsp.c).
* An SX126x sample implementation is in the file [ral_sx126x_bsp.c](../lbm_examples/radio_hal/ral_sx126x_bsp.c).
* An SX128x sample implementation is in the file [ral_sx128x_bsp.c](../lbm_examples/radio_hal/ral_sx128x_bsp.c).
* An SX127x sample implementation is in the file [ral_sx127x_bsp.c](../lbm_examples/radio_hal/ral_sx127x_bsp.c).

The role of the 'const void* context' variable is described in previous section. It is typically used to store radio-specific information, but depending on the radio driver BSP implementation, it may be NULL if a single transceiver is used.  
When compiling the RAL BSP implementation, it is necessary to add the radio driver source directory and the RAL source directory to the include path. For example, for LR11xx:
* `lbm_lib/smtc_modem_core/radio_drivers/lr11xx_driver/src`
* `lbm_lib/smtc_modem_core/smtc_ral/src`

## LoRa Basics Modem HAL Implementation

Porting LoRa Basics Modem to a new MCU architecture requires implementing the modem Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) API commands described by the prototypes in the header file [smtc_modem_hal.h](smtc_modem_hal/smtc_modem_hal.h).  
Among other things, these API implementations define how timing information is provided to the LoRa Basics Modem, how random numbers are generated, and how data is stored in non-volatile memory.  
If a TCXO is used on the radio part, its startup timing behavior should be specified in the RAL BSP implementation, and the documentation of the smtc_modem_hal_start_radio_tcxo(), smtc_modem_hal_stop_radio_tcxo(), and smtc_modem_hal_get_radio_tcxo_startup_delay_ms() functions, should be consulted.  

An example of implementation on STM32L476 and STM32L073 can be found in [smtc_modem_hal.c](../lbm_examples/smtc_modem_hal/smtc_modem_hal.c)
